My approach to the iSpindel project. Written in pure Python as best as possible.

Credits go to the creator of [iSPindel](http://www.ispindel.de/), universam1. Check out the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/universam1/iSpindel).

The original idea comes from the Tilt Hydrometer. There is no interest in replacing these gadgets, only the pleasure in DIY. Please go on and acquire one, if you can afford.
